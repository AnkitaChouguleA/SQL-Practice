# Project Title – Foodie-Fi Case Study

## 📌 Overview
This project is a detailed analysis of a subscription-based digital platform called "Foodie-Fi." The goal is to analyze customer subscriptions, track user journeys, and identify patterns in churn and growth using SQL.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
"Foodie-Fi," a subscription platform for food content, needs to understand its customer base better. The objective is to analyze subscription data to identify customer journeys, find the reasons for churn, and recommend strategies to improve customer retention and drive business growth.

---

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL** (to analyze customer subscription data)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control)

---

## 📁 Dataset
The project uses two tables from the **8-Week SQL Challenge**:
- `subscriptions`: Contains records of customers' subscription changes, including `customer_id`, `plan_id`, and `start_date`.
- `plans`: Provides details on the different subscription plans, including `plan_id`, `plan_name`, and `price`.

---

## 🧠 Approach
1. **Data Exploration:** Examined the `subscriptions` and `plans` tables to understand customer events and plan details.
2. **Subscription Analysis:** Wrote SQL queries to analyze customer growth, churn rates, and different subscription types.
3. **User Journey Mapping:** Tracked customer journeys from a free trial to a paid subscription, or to churn.
4. **Strategic Recommendations:** Used the data insights to propose business strategies for improving customer retention.

## 📈 Key Features
- Analysis of customer growth and monthly recurring revenue.
- Identification of churned customers and churn rates.
- Tracking of customer journeys from trial to paid plans.
- Calculation of key metrics like the number of customers on a free trial vs. paid plans.

---

## ✅ Results
- Identified the number of customers on each plan at different points in time.
- Calculated the number of customers who churned and the months they churned.
- Provided a clear view of customer journeys, such as how long customers stayed on a free trial before upgrading or churning.

## 📚 Learnings
- **Time-Series Analysis in SQL:** Gained experience with time-based analysis, such as tracking customer changes over a period of time.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Learned how to segment customers based on their subscription plans and status (active, churned).
- **Business Insight Generation:** Developed a deeper understanding of how to use SQL to solve real-world business problems related to SaaS (Software as a Service) metrics like churn.
