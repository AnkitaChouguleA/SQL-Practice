# My SQL Portfolio Projects - 8 Week SQL Challenge

This repository contains my solutions to the **8-Week SQL Challenge** by Danny Ma. The challenge consists of a series of realistic business case studies designed to sharpen SQL skills and problem-solving abilities.

Each case study is located in its own folder and includes:
- A `README.md` file with a project overview, problem statement, and key findings.
- An `.sql` file with the queries used to solve the business problem.
