# Project Title – Danny's Diner Case Study

## 📌 Overview
This project is an in-depth analysis of a diner's sales, menu, and customer data. The goal is to solve a series of business problems for the diner's owner by leveraging SQL to extract key insights about customer behavior, popular menu items, and revenue.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
The owner of "Danny's Diner" needs to understand his business better to make data-driven decisions. The objective is to analyze sales data to answer specific business questions, such as total customer spending, popular items, and member loyalty program insights.

---

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL** (to perform all data analysis)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control and project sharing)

---

## 📁 Dataset
The project uses three interconnected tables provided by the **8-Week SQL Challenge**:
- `sales`: Contains details on each order, including `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `product_id`.
- `menu`: Provides information on menu items and their prices.
- `members`: Tracks customers who have joined the diner's loyalty program.

---

## 🧠 Approach
1. **Data Exploration:** Explored the provided tables to understand the schema and data types.
2. **SQL Querying:** Wrote SQL queries to answer each of the business questions posed in the challenge.
3. **Insight Generation:** Used logical and analytical thinking to interpret the query results and draw conclusions.
4. **Documentation:** Documented the queries and their corresponding answers in a `.sql` file.

## 📈 Key Features
- SQL queries for customer-specific analysis.
- Insights into sales trends and popular menu items.
- Analysis of the impact of the diner's loyalty program.
